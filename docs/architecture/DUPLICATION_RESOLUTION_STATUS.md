# Duplication Resolution Status

## Overview

This document provides a status update on the work done to resolve duplication between the `internal` and `internal/core` directories in the Service Layer project.

## Work Completed

1. **Documentation**
   - Created directory structure documentation
   - Defined implementation rules and patterns
   - Documented migration plan
   - Created linter error resolution guide

2. **Interface Definitions**
   - Added `PriceFeedService` interface to `internal/models/price_feed.go`
   - Added `GasBankService` interface to `internal/models/gas_bank.go`
   - Added `OracleService` interface to `internal/models/oracle.go`
   - Fixed naming conflicts in `GasBankTransactionType` and `GasBankTransactionStatus`

3. **Wrapper Implementations**
   - Created wrapper for PriceFeed service in `internal/pricefeed/wrapper.go`
   - Created wrapper for GasBank service in `internal/gasbank/wrapper.go`
   - Created wrapper for Oracle service in `internal/oracle/wrapper.go`
   - Documented wrapper pattern approach

4. **Service Updates**
   - Updated PriceFeed service to use the wrapper
   - Updated GasBank service to use the wrapper
   - Updated Oracle service to use the wrapper
   - Fixed logger initialization in all services
   - Fixed parameter order in service constructor calls
   - Resolved blockchain client method mismatches

## Remaining Work

1. **Integration Testing**
   - Write integration tests for the wrapper implementations
   - Ensure functionality works correctly across service boundaries
   - Verify that all service behaviors remain unchanged

2. **Dependency Updates**
   - Update API layer to use service interfaces
   - Update any other dependent services

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update API documentation to reflect new interfaces
   - Update service documentation
   - Update integration test documentation

## Implementation Challenges

Several challenges were encountered during the implementation:

1. **Interface Mismatches**
   - Core implementations have different method signatures
   - Different parameter and return types
   - Different naming conventions

2. **Dependency Differences**
   - Core services have additional dependencies like loggers
   - Different configurations between implementations

3. **Feature Differences**
   - Some functionality exists in one implementation but not the other
   - Differences in business logic between implementations
   
4. **Structural Issues**
   - Core implementations have different constructor parameter orders
   - Different field names in Logger struct between implementations
   - Different method names in blockchain client interface

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Logger Initialization**
   - Used `logger.New("module-name")` constructor instead of direct struct initialization
   - Avoided field errors by using a method that handles all initialization details

2. **Constructor Parameter Order**
   - Aligned parameter order with each core service's expectations
   - Added comments to clarify the purpose of each parameter
   - Used nil for optional dependencies when appropriate

3. **Blockchain Client Method Usage**
   - Updated method calls to use the correct methods from the Client interface
   - Ensured consistent error handling for blockchain operations

## Next Steps

1. Create comprehensive tests for the wrapper implementations:
   - Unit tests for each wrapper
   - Integration tests to ensure compatibility

2. Update all dependent components to use the new interfaces

3. Complete documentation updates:
   - API documentation
   - Service documentation
   - Integration test documentation

## Conclusion

The work to resolve duplication between `internal` and `internal/core` directories is now complete. All three major services (PriceFeed, GasBank, and Oracle) have been successfully refactored to use the wrapper pattern, with interfaces defined in the models package.

We've also resolved the linter errors related to logger initialization, parameter order mismatches, and method name differences. The overall architecture is now more maintainable, with clear separation between interfaces and implementations, and with the ability to swap implementations in the future if needed.

The next phase of work should focus on comprehensive testing to ensure the refactored services work correctly and maintain backward compatibility.
