# Integration Testing Plan for Service Layer Wrapper Pattern

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive integration testing plan for validating the wrapper pattern implementation in the Service Layer project. The primary goal is to ensure that the wrapper implementations correctly delegate to the core services and maintain functional equivalence with the original implementations.

## Test Scope

The integration tests will cover the following services:

1. **PriceFeed Service**
2. **GasBank Service**
3. **Oracle Service**

## Testing Approach

### 1. Unit Tests for Wrappers

We have implemented unit tests for each wrapper to verify the correct delegation from wrapper methods to core service methods. These tests use mocks to isolate the wrapper functionality:

- `internal/pricefeed/wrapper_test.go`
- `internal/gasbank/wrapper_test.go`
- `internal/oracle/wrapper_test.go`

### 2. Integration Tests with Real Dependencies

For full integration testing, we will create scenarios that use the wrappers with actual dependencies. These tests will verify:

- Correct parameter conversion between interfaces
- Proper error handling and propagation
- End-to-end functionality

### 3. Performance Comparison

We will also measure and compare performance between the direct core implementation and the wrapper implementation to quantify any overhead.

## Test Environment Setup

For each service, we need to set up a test environment with:

1. **Database**:
   - In-memory SQLite database for isolation
   - Pre-populated with test data

2. **Blockchain**:
   - Mock blockchain client implementation
   - Simulated responses for blockchain operations

3. **TEE Environment**:
   - Mock TEE implementation for secure function execution
   - Simulated attestation

## Integration Test Scenarios

### PriceFeed Service

1. **Price Data Aggregation**:
   - Create a price feed with multiple sources
   - Configure mock data sources to return predefined prices
   - Trigger aggregation process
   - Verify correct median calculation and outlier filtering
   - Ensure contract update is attempted with correct parameters

2. **Price Feed Lifecycle**:
   - Create, retrieve, update, and delete a price feed
   - Verify correct storage and retrieval at each step
   - Test activation/deactivation functionality

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Test scenarios with source failures
   - Verify graceful handling when minimum valid sources requirement is not met
   - Test blockchain failures and verify proper error propagation

### GasBank Service

1. **Account Management**:
   - Create a gas bank account
   - Verify account details are stored correctly
   - Test account retrieval by ID, user ID, and wallet address

2. **Transaction Processing**:
   - Process deposits with various amounts
   - Request and process withdrawals
   - Verify balance updates occur correctly
   - Test fee deduction

3. **Transaction History**:
   - Generate multiple transactions of different types
   - Test retrieval and filtering of transaction history
   - Verify withdrawal request history

### Oracle Service

1. **Data Source Management**:
   - Create, retrieve, update, and delete data sources
   - Test data retrieval from external sources
   - Verify data transformation using scripts

2. **Oracle Updates**:
   - Create an oracle with a scheduled update
   - Trigger manual updates
   - Verify data is properly fetched, transformed, and stored
   - Test contract integration for publishing data

3. **Oracle Requests**:
   - Create and process oracle requests
   - Test callback functionality
   - Verify request status updates

## Test Data

For each test scenario, we will create specific test fixtures:

1. **Mock External APIs**:
   - Simulated price data sources
   - Weather API responses
   - Financial data sources

2. **Test Accounts**:
   - Pre-defined user accounts
   - Gas bank accounts with predefined balances
   - Test wallets with predefined addresses

3. **Blockchain Data**:
   - Test contracts with known addresses
   - Predefined transaction responses

## Test Execution

Tests will be executed in the following order:

1. Unit tests for individual wrappers
2. Integration tests for individual services
3. Cross-service integration tests (e.g., GasBank integration with PriceFeed updates)

## Success Criteria

The integration tests are considered successful if:

1. All test scenarios pass consistently
2. Wrapper implementation behavior matches original implementation
3. Error handling is consistent between implementations
4. Performance overhead is within acceptable limits (< 5% degradation)

## Failure Recovery

For any failed tests:

1. Isolate the failure to specific scenarios
2. Verify if the issue is in the wrapper or core implementation
3. Fix the implementation and repeat tests
4. Document any discovered edge cases

## Test Automation

All tests will be automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. The test suite should run:

1. On every pull request affecting service implementations
2. On scheduled runs to detect regression
3. Before production deployments

## Monitoring and Reporting

Test results will be reported with:

1. Detailed logs of each test case
2. Performance metrics comparing implementations
3. Coverage reports for wrappers and integration scenarios

## Conclusion

This integration testing plan provides a comprehensive strategy for validating the wrapper pattern implementation. By thoroughly testing each service in isolation and in combination, we can ensure that the refactoring to resolve duplication between `internal` and `internal/core` maintains all functionality while improving code organization.
