- **Last 7 Days**: Shows daily metrics for the past week
- **Last 30 Days**: Displays daily metrics for the past month

The dashboard automatically adjusts all visualizations and metrics based on the selected time range.

### Service Usage Analytics

The Service Usage tab provides insights into how different services are being utilized:

#### API Calls by Service

A bar chart visualization showing the total number of API calls for each service (Functions, Secrets, Automation, Price Feed, Random Number, Oracle, Gas Bank). This chart helps identify which services are most heavily used.

#### Service Usage Breakdown

A doughnut chart showing the percentage distribution of service usage. This provides a quick visual representation of how usage is distributed across different services.

#### Service KPIs

Key performance indicators for overall service usage:

- **Total API Calls**: The total number of API requests across all services
- **Unique Users**: Number of distinct users accessing the services
- **Avg. Response Time**: Average time to respond to API requests
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of API calls that resulted in errors

Each KPI includes a trend indicator showing the change from the previous period.

### Transaction Analytics

The Transactions tab offers detailed insights into blockchain transactions:

#### Transaction Volume

A line chart showing the volume of both successful and failed transactions over time. This helps identify trends and patterns in transaction activity.

#### Transaction Status Distribution

A pie chart breaking down transactions by their current status:

- Confirmed
- Pending
- Failed
- Expired

This visualization helps monitor the health of transaction processing.

#### Transaction Type Distribution

A doughnut chart showing the distribution of transactions by type:

- Contract Calls
- Oracle Updates
- Function Executions
- Price Feed Updates
- Random Number Generation

This visualization helps understand which types of blockchain operations are most common.

### Performance Analytics

The Performance tab provides insights into system performance metrics:

#### System Performance

A line chart tracking key performance indicators over time:

- Average Response Time (ms)
- CPU Usage (%)

This chart helps identify performance trends and potential bottlenecks.

#### Service Response Times

A bar chart showing the average response time for each service. This helps identify services that might need optimization.

#### Error Rates

A bar chart showing the error rate percentage for each service. This helps identify reliability issues in specific services.

### Resource Utilization

The Resource Utilization tab provides insights into system resource usage:

#### Resource Distribution

A doughnut chart showing how resources are utilized across different components:

- TEE Processing
- Blockchain Transactions
- Database Operations
- API Requests

This helps understand where system resources are being allocated.

#### Gas Consumption

A line chart showing gas consumption over time. This helps monitor blockchain resource usage and costs.

#### System Resource Metrics

Key system resource utilization metrics:

- CPU Usage
- Memory Usage
- Storage Usage
- Network I/O

Each metric includes a trend indicator showing the change from the previous period.
