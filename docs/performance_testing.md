# Performance Testing

## Overview

This document outlines the performance testing strategy for the Neo N3 Service Layer. Performance testing is critical to ensure the platform can handle expected loads, maintain responsive user experience, and provide reliable service under various conditions.

## Performance Testing Objectives

1. **Establish Performance Baselines**: Determine baseline performance metrics for all key operations
2. **Validate System Requirements**: Verify that the system meets defined performance requirements
3. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Locate performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
4. **Measure Scalability**: Assess how well the system scales with increased load
5. **Validate Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU, memory, network, and disk usage under load
6. **Ensure Reliability**: Verify system stability under sustained load over time

## Performance Testing Types

- Maintain steady load at expected operational levels
- Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization

### 2. Stress Testing

Stress testing evaluates system behavior beyond normal operational capacity to identify breaking points and failure modes.

**Focus Areas**:
- System stability under extreme loads
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Resource exhaustion behavior
- Queue management during traffic spikes

**Testing Approach**:
- Push the system beyond expected capacity
- Identify failure thresholds and error behavior

- Check for performance degradation over time
- Verify system stability for long-running processes

### 4. Spike Testing

Spike testing evaluates the system's ability to handle sudden, dramatic increases in load.

**Focus Areas**:
- Queue management during traffic spikes
- Resource allocation during load surges
- Recovery time after spike subsides
- Error rates during rapid load changes

**Testing Approach**:
- Simulate sudden increases in traffic (5-10x normal load)

- Test multiple consecutive spikes

### 5. Scalability Testing

Scalability testing assesses how effectively the system scales with increased resources.

**Focus Areas**:
