# Service Layer Core Implementation

## Overview
The core service implements the foundation for all Oracle services on Neo N3, managing the lifecycle of service requests, TEE environment, and blockchain interactions.

## Core Components

### Service Manager
- Coordinates all service components
- Handles initialization and shutdown
- Manages configuration and environment setup

### TEE Manager
- Interfaces with Azure Confidential Computing
- Ensures enclave integrity and attestation
- Manages the secure execution environment

### Blockchain Client
- Connects to Neo N3 blockchain
- Manages smart contract interactions
- Handles transaction signing and broadcasting

## Implementation Plan
1. Setup project structure and dependencies
2. Implement basic service manager
3. Create TEE integration with Azure
4. Develop Neo N3 blockchain client
5. Integrate components and establish communication patterns
