# JWT Validation Tests

This document outlines the JWT validation tests needed to ensure the security and reliability of the authentication system in the Service Layer project.

## Test Requirements

The JWT validation tests should cover the following aspects:

1. **Token Structure and Format Validation**
2. **Signature Verification**
3. **Claims Validation**
4. **Token Expiration**
5. **Security Headers**
6. **Attack Prevention**

## Test Specifications

### 1. Token Structure and Format Validation

| Test ID | Description | Expected Outcome |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| JWT-STR-01 | Verify JWT has three parts separated by dots | Valid format accepted, invalid format rejected |
| JWT-STR-02 | Verify each part is properly base64url encoded | Invalid encoding rejected |
| JWT-STR-03 | Verify header contains the algorithm and token type | Malformed header rejected |
| JWT-STR-04 | Verify payload contains required claims | Missing required claims rejected |

### 2. Signature Verification

| Test ID | Description | Expected Outcome |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| JWT-SIG-01 | Verify tokens with valid signatures are accepted | Valid signature accepted |
| JWT-SIG-02 | Verify tokens with invalid signatures are rejected | Invalid signature rejected |
| JWT-SIG-03 | Verify tokens with missing signatures are rejected | Missing signature rejected |
| JWT-SIG-04 | Verify algorithm in header matches signing method | Mismatch in algorithm rejected |

### 3. Claims Validation

| Test ID | Description | Expected Outcome |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| JWT-CLM-01 | Verify required claims (iss, exp, iat, etc.) are present | Missing claims rejected |
| JWT-CLM-02 | Verify issuer claim matches expected value | Invalid issuer rejected |
| JWT-CLM-03 | Verify custom claims (user_id, username) are present | Missing custom claims rejected |
| JWT-CLM-04 | Verify claims have correct data types | Invalid data types rejected |

### 4. Token Expiration

| Test ID | Description | Expected Outcome |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| JWT-EXP-01 | Verify expired tokens are rejected | Expired token rejected |
| JWT-EXP-02 | Verify tokens that are not yet valid (nbf claim) are rejected | Not yet valid token rejected |
| JWT-EXP-03 | Verify reasonable expiration times are set | Expiration time matches configuration |
| JWT-EXP-04 | Verify refresh token system works properly | Refresh token generates new valid tokens |

### 5. Security Headers

| Test ID | Description | Expected Outcome |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| JWT-SEC-01 | Verify Authorization header is required for protected endpoints | Missing header request rejected |
| JWT-SEC-02 | Verify correct Bearer format is enforced | Invalid format rejected |
| JWT-SEC-03 | Verify token is transmitted securely (HTTPS) | Token not exposed in insecure channels |

### 6. Attack Prevention

| Test ID | Description | Expected Outcome |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| JWT-ATK-01 | Test against algorithm confusion attacks | Algorithm confusion attempt rejected |
| JWT-ATK-02 | Test against token replay attacks | Replayed tokens rejected with proper controls |
| JWT-ATK-03 | Test against token sidejacking | Proper security measures prevent sidejacking |
| JWT-ATK-04 | Test against cross-site request forgery | CSRF protection verified |
| JWT-ATK-05 | Test against token storage in insecure locations | Best practices for token storage followed |

## Implementation Plan

The following implementation steps should be taken to create these JWT validation tests:

1. Implement a comprehensive test suite in `test/security/jwt_validation_test.go`
2. Extend existing `auth_security_test.go` with additional cases
3. Create integration tests for JWT validation across services
4. Create API-level tests for JWT validation in endpoints

## Dependencies

- Go testing framework
- JWT library (github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go or github.com/golang-jwt/jwt)
- HTTP client for API testing
- Mocking library for isolating components

## Expected Deliverables

1. Complete JWT validation test suite
2. Documentation of test results
3. Recommendations for any security improvements identified

## Security Best Practices

- Use strong, unique secret keys for JWT signing
- Implement proper key rotation mechanisms
- Keep token lifetimes short
- Use HTTPS for all token transmission
- Implement proper logout mechanisms
- Store tokens securely on the client side
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak information
