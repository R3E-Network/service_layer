   - ✅ Added IP-based and API key-based limiting
   - ✅ Implemented API key rotation mechanism
   - ✅ Added comprehensive audit logging system
   - ✅ Added security monitoring and alerting

8. **Integration Testing**
   - ✅ Created test framework for service integration
   - ✅ Implemented Auth integration tests
   - ✅ Implemented Functions & Secrets integration tests
   - ✅ Implemented TEE & Blockchain integration tests
   - ✅ Created Oracle service integration tests
   - ✅ Implemented Price Feed service integration tests
   - ⚠️ Gas Bank integration tests in progress

## Current Status

The Service Layer is now significantly closer to production-ready status, with the core TEE security features fully implemented and tested. The JavaScript runtime provides a secure environment for executing user functions with proper isolation, memory limits, and timeout enforcement. The secret management system offers enhanced security with envelope encryption and key rotation. Performance optimizations have been implemented including database query optimizations with denormalized fields, indices, and optimized repositories. A comprehensive monitoring system is now in place with Prometheus metrics collection, system metrics collection, and Grafana dashboards.

Integration testing has made significant progress, with comprehensive tests for authentication flows, functions and secrets interaction, TEE blockchain integration, Oracle services, and Price Feed services. We've developed a robust integration test framework that uses mock services where appropriate while still testing all critical interaction paths. Our Price Feed integration tests verify price data aggregation from multiple sources, outlier detection and rejection, and blockchain price updates.

## Next Steps

To bring the Service Layer to production-ready status, we need to focus on the following areas:

1. **Complete Integration Testing**
   - Complete Gas Bank integration tests
   - Implement Automation service integration tests
   - Add Random Number integration tests

2. **API Enhancement**
   - Document all APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Implement consistent error handling
   - Create comprehensive client examples

3. **DevOps Integration**
   - Fix CI/CD pipeline
   - Create automated deployment process
   - Add integration testing to CI pipeline
   - Create development and production environments
