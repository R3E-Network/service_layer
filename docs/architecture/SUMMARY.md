# Directory Structure Refactoring Summary

## Overview

We have identified and created a plan to resolve the duplication issues between `internal` and `internal/core` directories in the Service Layer project. This duplication has led to confusion, maintenance challenges, and potential bugs.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Documentation-First Approach**
   - Created detailed documentation of the current structure and issues
   - Documented proposed structure with clear rules and rationale
   - Created a comprehensive migration plan
   - Provided reference implementations

2. **Interface Definitions**
   - Added service interfaces to the `models` package
   - Ensured interfaces represent complete service functionality
   - Used proper context.Context for all methods
   - Added service lifecycle methods (Start/Stop)

3. **Wrapper Pattern**
   - Designed a wrapper pattern to delegate to core implementations
   - Created a reference implementation for PriceFeed service
   - Documented potential issues and their solutions

4. **Migration Process**
   - Outlined a step-by-step migration approach
   - Created a testing strategy
   - Documented rollout plan with staging steps

## Files Created

1. `/docs/architecture/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` - Documents the current and proposed directory structure
2. `/docs/architecture/DUPLICATION_RESOLUTION_PLAN.md` - Details the step-by-step plan for each service
3. `/docs/architecture/MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive migration plan with testing and rollout strategy
4. `/docs/examples/PRICEFEED_WRAPPER_EXAMPLE.go` - Reference implementation for the wrapper pattern

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation Priority**
   - Start with PriceFeed service as the prototype
   - Continue with GasBank and Oracle services
   - Update all dependents to use the new interfaces

2. **Testing**
   - Ensure all tests pass with the new structure
   - Add tests specifically for the wrapper implementations

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update API documentation to reflect the new structure
   - Document any breaking changes

4. **Future Improvements**
   - Consider removing duplicate directories once migration is complete
   - Standardize this pattern across all services

## Conclusion

This refactoring will significantly improve the maintainability and clarity of the codebase by eliminating duplication and establishing clear patterns for service implementations. The documentation-first approach ensures that the team understands the rationale and process before any code changes are made.
