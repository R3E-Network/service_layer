# Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the performance optimization strategy for the Neo N3 Service Layer. Based on the results of our performance testing, we have identified several areas for optimization to improve overall system performance, scalability, and resource efficiency.

## Performance Testing Summary

Our performance testing has identified the following key areas for improvement:

1. **API Response Times**: Some API endpoints show higher than desired response times under load, particularly for functions execution and transaction management.

2. **Database Performance**: Query performance degrades under high concurrent load, particularly for complex queries involving multiple tables.

3. **Resource Utilization**: Memory usage grows significantly during sustained operations, indicating potential memory leaks or inefficient resource management.

4. **Transaction Processing**: Transaction submission and monitoring show bottlenecks when handling a large number of concurrent transactions.

5. **TEE Performance**: JavaScript function execution in the TEE environment shows higher latency than desired, especially for complex functions.
