## Test Documentation

Each test should include:

1. **Test ID**: Unique identifier

3. **Preconditions**: Required setup
4. **Test Steps**: Actions to perform
5. **Expected Results**: Expected outcomes
6. **Actual Results**: Observed outcomes
7. **Status**: Pass/Fail/Blocked
8. **Defects**: Links to related defects

## Defect Management

Defects will be tracked with the following process:

1. **Discovery**: Document and reproduce
2. **Classification**: Assign severity and priority
3. **Assignment**: Assign to development team
4. **Resolution**: Fix and document solution
5. **Verification**: Test fix and close if resolved

### Defect Severity Levels

1. **Critical**: System unusable, no workarounds
2. **Major**: Significant feature broken, workarounds possible
3. **Minor**: Non-critical feature affected
4. **Cosmetic**: UI or documentation issues

## Test Exit Criteria

Testing phases will be considered complete when:

1. All planned tests are executed
2. No critical or major defects remain unresolved
3. Test coverage meets targets (80% for core components)
4. Performance meets or exceeds targets
5. Security vulnerabilities are addressed

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Neo N3 testnet instability | High | Medium | Use private networks, mock blockchain responses |
