# DevOps Integration Documentation

This document outlines the DevOps infrastructure and practices for the Neo N3 Service Layer project.

## Overview

The Service Layer project follows a GitOps approach to infrastructure management and uses a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment. The infrastructure is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and consists of the following stages:

1. **Setup**: Prepares the environment for building and testing
2. **Lint**: Ensures code quality through static analysis
3. **Build**: Compiles the code and creates artifacts
4. **Unit Tests**: Executes unit tests with code coverage
5. **Integration Tests**: Runs integration tests against dependencies
6. **Security Scan**: Performs security analysis on the codebase
7. **Performance Test**: Evaluates API performance and resource usage
8. **Docker Build**: Creates container images
9. **Helm Package**: Packages Kubernetes manifests for deployment
10. **Deployment**: Automatically deploys to staging or production environments
11. **Notification**: Sends alerts about the pipeline status

## Environments

The project supports multiple deployment environments:

### Development
- Local development environment
- Uses Docker Compose for local service orchestration
- Connects to local or containerized databases
- Uses mock implementations for external services

### Staging
- Pre-production environment
- Identical to production but with fewer resources
- Used for integration testing and final verification
- Automatically updated from the `develop` branch

### Production
- Production environment
- Deployed on Kubernetes
- Highly available with auto-scaling
- Protected by network policies
- Only deployed from the `main` branch or manually approved workflows

## Infrastructure as Code

All infrastructure is defined as code using the following technologies:

1. **Docker**: Container images for services
2. **Docker Compose**: Local development environment
3. **Kubernetes**: Production and staging orchestration
4. **Terraform**: Cloud infrastructure provisioning
5. **Helm**: Kubernetes package management

## Monitoring and Observability

The system uses the following tools for monitoring and observability:

1. **Prometheus**: Metrics collection
2. **Grafana**: Dashboards and visualization
3. **Loki**: Log aggregation
4. **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing
5. **Alert Manager**: Alert routing

## Security Practices

The DevOps pipeline incorporates security scanning through:

1. **Gosec**: Static analysis for security issues
2. **Nancy**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
3. **Gitleaks**: Secret detection
4. **Trivy**: Container image scanning
5. **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

## Deployment Strategy

The project uses a rolling update strategy for zero-downtime deployments:

1. New versions are deployed to a subset of nodes
2. Health checks verify the new version
3. Traffic is gradually shifted to the new version
4. Old versions are removed after successful transition

## Configuration Management

Configuration is managed through:

1. **Environment Variables**: For sensitive or environment-specific values
2. **Config Maps**: For general configuration
3. **Secrets**: For credentials and sensitive data
4. **Azure Key Vault**: For advanced secret management

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

The system includes:

1. **Database Backups**: Regular automated backups
2. **Point-in-Time Recovery**: For database restoration
3. **Terraform State Backups**: For infrastructure recovery
4. **Multi-Region Deployment**: (Planned) For geographic redundancy
5. **Failover Procedures**: Documented in the BACKUP_RECOVERY.md document
