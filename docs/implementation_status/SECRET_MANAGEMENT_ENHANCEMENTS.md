# Enhanced Secret Management Implementation

This document outlines the enhanced secret management implementation for the Service Layer project.

## Overview

The Service Layer now includes a robust secret management system that provides secure storage and management of user secrets within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). This implementation addresses several key security concerns:

1. Secrets are encrypted at rest using envelope encryption
2. Encryption keys are rotated regularly
3. All secret access is audited
4. User secrets are completely isolated from each other
5. Metadata provides tracking of secret usage and versions
6. Import/export capabilities enable backup and migration

## Features

### Envelope Encryption

The secret management system uses envelope encryption for maximum security:

1. **Master Key**: A single data key encryption key (master key) is used to encrypt individual data keys
2. **Data Keys**: Multiple data keys are generated and rotated regularly
3. **Secret Encryption**: Each secret is encrypted with its own data key
4. **Key Rotation**: Data keys are rotated automatically at configurable intervals

This multi-layered approach ensures that even if a single data key is compromised, only secrets encrypted with that specific key are at risk, and the master key remains secure.

### Comprehensive Auditing

All operations on secrets are logged in a secure audit trail:

- Secret creation
- Secret access
- Secret updates
- Secret deletion
- Secret exports/imports

Each audit entry includes:
- Timestamp
- User ID
- Secret name
- Action type
- Success/failure status

This provides a complete history of all secret operations for security monitoring and compliance purposes.

### Secret Metadata

Each secret includes metadata that provides additional context and management capabilities:

- Creation time
- Last update time
- Last access time
- Version number
- Custom tags

This metadata enables better secret management and lifecycle tracking.

### User Isolation

The secret management system ensures complete isolation between users:

- Each user's secrets are stored in separate namespaces
- Access controls prevent users from accessing another user's secrets
- Operations on one user's secrets do not affect other users

### Secure Import/Export

The secret management system supports secure import and export of secrets:

- Exports are protected with cryptographic hashes to ensure integrity
- Imports validate data integrity before accepting secrets
- Export and import operations are logged in the audit trail

## Implementation

The secret management system is implemented in the `internal/tee/secret_store.go` file and includes the following components:

### Data Structures

```go
// SecretMetadata contains metadata about a secret
type SecretMetadata struct {
    CreatedAt  time.Time
    UpdatedAt  time.Time
    AccessedAt time.Time
    Version    int
    Tags       []string
}

// EncryptedSecret represents an encrypted secret with metadata
type EncryptedSecret struct {
    EncryptedData []byte
    IV            []byte
    KeyID         string
    Metadata      SecretMetadata
}

// EnhancedSecretStore provides a secure secret store with encryption
type EnhancedSecretStore struct {
    dataKeyEncryptionKey []byte
    dataKeys             map[string][]byte
    secrets              map[int]map[string]EncryptedSecret
    // ... other fields
}

// AuditEntry represents an audit log entry for secret access
type AuditEntry struct {
    Timestamp  time.Time
    UserID     int
    SecretName string
    Action     string
    Success    bool
}
```

### Key Operations

The secret management system includes the following key operations:

- **Key Generation**: New data keys are generated using secure random generators
- **Key Encryption**: Data keys are encrypted with the master key
- **Key Rotation**: Keys are automatically rotated based on a configurable interval
- **Key Management**: Keys are stored securely in memory within the TEE

### Secret Operations

The secret management system supports the following operations:

- `GetSecret`: Retrieves a secret for a user
- `SetSecret`: Sets or updates a secret for a user
- `DeleteSecret`: Deletes a secret for a user
- `ListSecrets`: Lists all secrets for a user
- `GetSecretMetadata`: Gets metadata for a secret
- `UpdateSecretTags`: Updates tags for a secret
- `GetAuditLog`: Gets the audit log for a user
- `ExportSecrets`: Exports all secrets for a user
- `ImportSecrets`: Imports secrets for a user

## Security Considerations

The enhanced secret management implementation takes into account several security considerations:

1. **Memory Safety**: Secret data is only decrypted when needed and is not persisted in memory
2. **Cryptographic Best Practices**: Uses AES-256 encryption with proper IV handling
3. **Key Rotation**: Regular key rotation limits the impact of key compromise
4. **Auditing**: Complete audit trail for all operations aids in security monitoring
5. **Isolation**: Strong isolation between users prevents unauthorized access

## Testing

The secret management system includes comprehensive tests:

- **Basic Functionality Tests**: Testing of all core operations
- **Key Rotation Tests**: Verification of key rotation functionality
- **Multi-User Isolation Tests**: Ensuring users can't access each other's secrets
- **Encryption Security Tests**: Verifying that secrets are properly encrypted

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation provides robust security, future enhancements could include:

1. **Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration**: Storing the master key in an HSM for additional security
2. **Fine-grained Access Controls**: Role-based access controls for secrets within a user's namespace
3. **Secret Sharing**: Secure mechanisms for sharing secrets between users
4. **Automated Secret Rotation**: Policies for automatic rotation of secrets themselves
5. **Analytics and Reporting**: Enhanced reporting on secret usage and access patterns

## Conclusion

The enhanced secret management implementation provides a secure and robust foundation for managing sensitive information within the Service Layer. By using envelope encryption, comprehensive auditing, and strong isolation, the system ensures that user secrets are protected with multiple layers of security.
