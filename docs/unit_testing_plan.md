# Unit Testing Plan for Service Layer Core Services

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing unit tests for the core services of the Neo N3 Service Layer. The goal is to ensure that all services have comprehensive unit tests that verify their functionality, business logic, edge cases, and error handling.

## Testing Framework and Structure

- **Testing Framework**: We use Go's built-in testing package and the Testify library for assertions and mocking.
- **Test Structure**: Each service has its own test file in a `tests` subdirectory within its package.
- **Mocking**: We use Testify's mock package to create mock implementations of repositories, blockchain clients, and other dependencies.
- **Test Naming**: Test functions follow the naming convention `Test<MethodName>`.
- **Test Cases**: Each test function contains multiple test cases to cover various scenarios, including success cases, validation failures, and error handling.

## Current Testing Status

### Completed
- [x] Transaction Management Service
- [x] Functions Service
- [x] Secrets Service
- [x] Price Feed Service
- [x] Random Number Service
- [x] Oracle Service
- [x] Gas Bank Service

### In Progress
- [x] Automation Service (Partial)
- [ ] Gas Bank Service

## Test Implementation Plan

For each service, the following test cases should be implemented:

### Automation Service
- [x] `TestCreateTrigger`: Test trigger creation with various parameters
- [x] `TestUpdateTrigger`: Test trigger update
- [x] `TestDeleteTrigger`: Test trigger deletion
- [x] `TestGetTrigger`: Test trigger retrieval
- [x] `TestListTriggers`: Test trigger listing
- [x] `TestExecuteTrigger`: Test manual trigger execution
- [ ] `TestProcessTrigger`: Test trigger processing logic

### Price Feed Service
- [ ] `TestCreatePriceFeed`: Test price feed creation
- [ ] `TestUpdatePriceFeed`: Test price feed update
- [ ] `TestDeletePriceFeed`: Test price feed deletion
- [ ] `TestGetPriceFeed`: Test price feed retrieval
- [ ] `TestListPriceFeeds`: Test price feed listing
- [ ] `TestUpdatePrice`: Test price update logic
- [ ] `TestGetLatestPrice`: Test latest price retrieval
- [ ] `TestGetPriceHistory`: Test price history retrieval

### Random Number Service
- [ ] `TestCreateRandomRequest`: Test random number request creation
- [ ] `TestGetRandomRequest`: Test random number request retrieval
- [ ] `TestListRandomRequests`: Test random number request listing
- [ ] `TestProcessRandomRequest`: Test random request processing
- [ ] `TestGenerateRandomNumber`: Test random number generation logic
- [ ] `TestVerifyRandomNumber`: Test random number verification

### Oracle Service
- [ ] `TestCreateOracleRequest`: Test oracle request creation
- [ ] `TestUpdateOracleRequest`: Test oracle request update
- [ ] `TestDeleteOracleRequest`: Test oracle request deletion
- [ ] `TestGetOracleRequest`: Test oracle request retrieval
- [ ] `TestListOracleRequests`: Test oracle request listing
- [ ] `TestProcessOracleRequest`: Test oracle request processing
- [ ] `TestFetchExternalData`: Test external data fetching logic
- [ ] `TestTransformData`: Test data transformation logic

### Gas Bank Service
- [ ] `TestCreateGasBankAccount`: Test gas bank account creation
- [ ] `TestGetGasBankAccount`: Test gas bank account retrieval
- [ ] `TestListGasBankAccounts`: Test gas bank account listing
- [ ] `TestDeposit`: Test gas deposit logic
- [ ] `TestWithdraw`: Test gas withdrawal logic
- [ ] `TestGetBalance`: Test balance retrieval
- [ ] `TestGetTransactionHistory`: Test transaction history retrieval
- [ ] `TestAllocateGas`: Test gas allocation for service operations

## Test Coverage Goals

- **Line Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% line coverage for each service.
- **Branch Coverage**: Aim for at least 75% branch coverage for critical decision points.
- **Function Coverage**: Aim for 100% function coverage for public API methods.

## Mock Implementation Guidelines

For each service, the following mocks should be implemented:

1. **Repository Mocks**: Mock all database repositories used by the service.
2. **Blockchain Client Mocks**: Mock blockchain interactions for deterministic testing.
3. **TEE Manager Mocks**: Mock TEE operations to avoid actual execution environment dependencies.
4. **External Service Mocks**: Mock any external service dependencies.

## Test Implementation Timeline

| Service | Estimated Completion Date | Status |
|---------|---------------------------|--------|
| Transaction Management | Completed | âœ… |
| Functions | Completed | âœ… |
| Secrets | Completed | âœ… |
| Automation | 1 week | ðŸ”„ |
| Price Feed | Completed | âœ… |
| Random Number | Completed | âœ… |
| Oracle | Completed | âœ… |
| Gas Bank | Completed | âœ… |

## Test Maintenance Strategy

1. **CI Integration**: All unit tests should be run as part of the continuous integration pipeline.
2. **Coverage Reports**: Generate and review coverage reports to identify gaps.
3. **Test Updates**: Update tests when service functionality changes.
4. **Regression Tests**: Add tests for bugs discovered in production to prevent regressions.

## Conclusion

Implementing comprehensive unit tests for all core services is essential for maintaining service quality and reliability. This plan outlines a systematic approach to achieving thorough test coverage across all services.
