# Audit Logging Implementation

This document describes the audit logging implementation for the Service Layer.

## Overview

Audit logging is essential for security, compliance, and troubleshooting. It provides a tamper-evident record of all security-relevant actions within the system, allowing for detection of suspicious activities, forensic analysis after incidents, and compliance with industry regulations.

## Design Principles

The audit logging system follows these key principles:

1. **Completeness**: All security-relevant events are logged
2. **Integrity**: Logs cannot be modified or deleted without detection
3. **Availability**: Logs are available for analysis when needed
4. **Confidentiality**: Sensitive information in logs is protected
5. **Usability**: Logs are in a format that is easy to search and analyze

## Types of Events Logged

The following types of events are captured in audit logs:

1. **Authentication Events**
   - Login attempts (successful and failed)
   - Password changes
   - Multifactor authentication events
   - Session management (creation, expiration, invalidation)

2. **Authorization Events**
   - Authorization decisions (access granted or denied)
   - Permission changes
   - Role assignments

3. **User and Account Management**
   - User creation, modification, deletion
   - API key management (creation, rotation, revocation)
   - Team/organization management

4. **Data Access and Modification**
   - Access to sensitive data
   - Data modification operations
   - Function executions and their results
   - Secret access and modifications

5. **System Configuration**
   - Configuration changes
   - Environment changes
   - Security control modifications

6. **System Operations**
   - Service starts and stops
   - System failures and errors
   - Backup and recovery operations
   - Scheduled tasks

## Log Structure

Each audit log entry contains:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-event-id",
  "timestamp": "2023-06-20T15:04:05Z",
  "event_type": "user.login",
  "severity": "info",
  "actor": {
    "id": "user-id",
    "type": "user",
    "name": "username",
    "ip": "client-ip-address"
  },
  "target": {
    "id": "resource-id",
    "type": "resource-type",
    "name": "resource-name"
  },
  "action": {
    "type": "read",
    "status": "success",
    "reason": "authorized"
  },
  "context": {
    "request_id": "correlation-id",
    "session_id": "user-session-id",
    "application": "web-ui or api"
  },
  "metadata": {
    // Additional event-specific details
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Log Storage

Audit logs are stored in multiple locations to ensure integrity and availability:

1. **Local Storage**: JSON logs stored in rotating files
2. **Database**: Structured logs stored in a dedicated audit_logs table
3. **External Service**: Logs forwarded to a secure SIEM or logging service

### Database Schema

```
Table: audit_logs
- id: UUID (primary key)
- timestamp: Timestamp with timezone
- event_type: String (indexed)
- severity: String (enum: debug, info, warning, error, critical)
- actor_id: String (indexed)
- actor_type: String
- actor_name: String
- actor_ip: String
- target_id: String (indexed)
- target_type: String
- target_name: String
- action_type: String
- action_status: String
- action_reason: String
- request_id: String (indexed)
- session_id: String
- application: String
- metadata: JSONB (for additional details)
```

### Integrity Protection

To protect log integrity, we implement:

1. **Cryptographic Signatures**: Log entries are signed to detect tampering
2. **Secure Timestamps**: Timestamps are derived from a trusted time source
3. **Sequential Identifiers**: Logs use sequential IDs to detect missing records
4. **Immutable Storage**: Logs are stored in append-only storage where possible

### Access Control

Access to audit logs is tightly controlled:

1. **Role-Based Access**: Only authorized administrators can access logs
2. **Separation of Duties**: Log administrators are different from system administrators
3. **Access Logging**: All access to audit logs is itself logged

## Search and Analysis

The audit logging system includes tools for searching and analyzing logs:

1. **Structured Queries**: Support for SQL-like queries on structured log data
2. **Full-Text Search**: Ability to search all fields in logs
3. **Correlation**: Tools to correlate events across different services
4. **Visualization**: Dashboards for common security metrics
5. **Alerting**: Real-time alerts for suspicious activity

## Retention Policy

Audit logs are retained according to the following policy:

1. **Short-term Retention**: Full logs are retained for 90 days in hot storage
2. **Long-term Retention**: Compressed logs are retained for 7 years in cold storage
3. **Legal Hold**: Logs related to known incidents are preserved indefinitely

## Compliance Requirements

The audit logging implementation meets the following compliance requirements:

1. **SOC 2**: Ensures appropriate logging for security incidents
2. **GDPR**: Allows tracking of personal data access and modifications
3. **HIPAA**: Provides adequate audit trails for protected health information
4. **PCI-DSS**: Meets requirements for cardholder data environment logging

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements to the audit logging system:

1. **Machine Learning**: Implement anomaly detection for suspicious activity
2. **Enhanced Correlation**: Improve correlation across services and environments
3. **User Activity Timeline**: Create visual timelines of user activities
4. **Tamper-Evident Blockchain**: Implement blockchain-based log verification
5. **Enhanced Retention Management**: Implement more sophisticated retention policies
