# Next Steps for Service Layer Architecture

## Overview

We have successfully addressed the duplication issues between the `internal` and `internal/core` directories by implementing a wrapper pattern. This document outlines the next steps to further improve the architecture and move toward production readiness.

## Completed Work

1. **Wrapper Pattern Implementation**
   - Created interfaces in the `models` package for all three services
   - Implemented wrappers for PriceFeed, GasBank, and Oracle services
   - Updated service implementations to use the wrappers
   - Fixed linter errors and parameter mismatches

2. **Unit Testing**
   - Implemented comprehensive unit tests for each wrapper
   - Created mock implementations of core services
   - Validated parameter passing and return value handling

3. **Documentation**
   - Created architectural documentation explaining the wrapper pattern
   - Documented common error patterns and their solutions
   - Developed an integration testing plan

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Run and Fix Current Unit Tests**
   - Execute all unit tests for wrappers
   - Address any failures or edge cases
   - Ensure all tests pass consistently

2. **Implement Integration Tests**
   - Follow the integration testing plan
   - Create test fixtures for each service
   - Implement cross-service integration tests

3. **Fix Remaining Linter Errors**
   - Resolve any remaining linter issues
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions
   - Address type compatibility issues

## Mid-term Goals

1. **API Layer Updates**
   - Update API handlers to use the service interfaces
   - Implement consistent error handling
   - Document APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Measure performance of wrapper implementations
   - Identify and address any bottlenecks
   - Implement caching where appropriate

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update API documentation to reflect new interfaces
   - Document service behaviors and guarantees
   - Create examples and usage guides

## Long-term Goals

1. **Complete Service Abstraction**
   - Move to using interfaces exclusively for all services
   - Remove direct dependencies on implementations
   - Enable easy swapping of implementations

2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - Achieve high test coverage for all components
   - Implement end-to-end tests for critical paths
   - Add property-based testing for complex logic

3. **Architecture Refinement**
   - Continue improving separation of concerns
   - Optimize for developer experience
   - Ensure maintainability and extensibility

## Implementation Priorities

| Priority | Task | Estimated Effort | Dependencies |
|----------|------|------------------|--------------|
| High | Run and fix current unit tests | 1 day | None |
| High | Implement integration tests for PriceFeed | 2 days | Unit tests |
| High | Implement integration tests for GasBank | 2 days | Unit tests |
| Medium | Implement integration tests for Oracle | 2 days | Unit tests |
| Medium | Update API layer to use interfaces | 3 days | All integration tests |
| Medium | Documentation updates | 2 days | None |
| Low | Performance optimization | 3 days | Integration tests |
| Low | End-to-end testing | 5 days | API layer updates |

## Conclusion

The implementation of the wrapper pattern has significantly improved the architecture by eliminating duplication and establishing clear interfaces between components. By following the next steps outlined in this document, we can build on this foundation to create a highly maintainable, well-tested, and production-ready service layer.

The integration testing plan provides a clear roadmap for validating that our wrapper implementations maintain the same functionality as the original services. Once completed, we can confidently move forward with updating dependent components and optimizing performance.
