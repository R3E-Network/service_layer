# Neo N3 Service Layer Implementation Status

## Progress Update

**Latest Update (Date: 2023-03-24):** We have made significant progress on testing and transaction management. 

1. We've created a comprehensive **Testing Plan** that covers unit testing, integration testing, security testing, and performance testing. This plan provides a framework for comprehensive verification of all service components.

2. We've implemented unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests for the **Transaction Management System**, focusing on transaction creation, retrieval, and monitoring. These tests verify functionality, measure performance, and ensure reliability under concurrent load.

3. The **Transaction Management System** implementation is now almost complete, with core components such as transaction creation, submission, monitoring, and verification fully implemented. The system provides a robust foundation for all blockchain interactions.
