# Gas Bank Integration Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing integration tests for the Gas Bank service. The Gas Bank is a critical component that manages gas funds for transaction execution on the Neo N3 blockchain. The integration tests will verify the correct functioning of deposit flow, withdrawal flow, and balance management.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify deposit flow from external wallets to Gas Bank
2. Validate withdrawal flow from Gas Bank to user wallets
3. Ensure accurate balance tracking and management
4. Test transaction fee handling
5. Verify proper error handling and recovery

## Test Components

The Gas Bank integration tests will include the following components:

1. **Gas Bank Service** - The main service under test
2. **Blockchain Client** - For interacting with the Neo N3 blockchain
3. **TEE Environment** - For secure transaction processing
4. **Database** - For storing balance and transaction records
5. **User Authentication** - For verifying user permissions

## Test Cases

### 1. Deposit Flow

**Description**: Test the complete deposit flow from external wallets to the Gas Bank.

**Test Steps**:

1. Create a test user account
2. Create a test wallet for the user
3. Initialize the Gas Bank service with a mock blockchain
4. Simulate a deposit transaction from an external wallet
5. Verify the deposit is detected and processed
6. Check the user's balance is updated correctly
7. Verify transaction records are created

**Success Criteria**:

- The deposit transaction is correctly detected by the Gas Bank service
- The user's balance is updated with the correct amount
- Transaction records show the correct details
- Confirmations are processed properly

### 2. Withdrawal Flow

**Description**: Test the withdrawal flow from Gas Bank to user wallets.

**Test Steps**:

1. Set up a test account with an existing balance
2. Create a withdrawal request for a valid amount
3. Verify the request is processed through the TEE
4. Check the transaction is submitted to the blockchain
5. Verify the user's balance is updated after confirmation
6. Test withdrawal request with insufficient funds
7. Test withdrawal request exceeding daily limits

**Success Criteria**:

- The withdrawal transaction is correctly created and signed in TEE
- The user's balance is updated only after blockchain confirmation
- Proper error handling for insufficient funds cases
- Proper enforcement of withdrawal limits
- Transaction records show the correct withdrawal details

### 3. Balance Management

**Description**: Test the balance tracking and management system.

**Test Steps**:

1. Set up multiple test accounts with different balances
2. Perform multiple deposit and withdrawal operations
3. Verify balances are correctly maintained throughout operations
4. Test concurrent balance updates
5. Verify balance consistency after service restart
6. Test balance queries and transaction history retrieval

**Success Criteria**:

- Account balances are consistently maintained through transactions
- Concurrent transactions are handled correctly without race conditions
- Transaction history correctly shows all operations
- Balance queries return accurate information

### 4. Fee Handling

**Description**: Test the handling of transaction fees.

**Test Steps**:

1. Set up a test account with an existing balance
2. Configure different fee settings in the Gas Bank
3. Perform transactions with different fees
4. Verify fee calculation is correct
5. Check fee deduction from appropriate accounts
6. Verify fee distribution to the system account

**Success Criteria**:

- Transaction fees are calculated correctly based on configuration
- Fees are properly deducted from user balances
- Fee distribution to system accounts is accurate
- Fee records are maintained properly

### 5. Error Handling and Recovery

**Description**: Test the system's ability to handle errors and recover.

**Test Steps**:

1. Simulate blockchain network failures during transactions
2. Test transaction submission failures
3. Verify the system can recover from failed transactions
4. Test handling of double-deposit scenarios
5. Verify system recovery after service interruption

**Success Criteria**:

- Failed transactions are properly handled without balance corruption
- Double-deposits are correctly identified and prevented
- The system can recover from service interruptions
- Error states are logged and reported correctly

## Implementation Approach

The Gas Bank integration tests will be implemented using the following approach:

1. **Mock Services**:
   - Create a mock blockchain client that simulates the Neo N3 blockchain
   - Implement a mock TEE environment for secure transaction testing

2. **Test Framework**:
   - Extend the existing integration test framework
   - Use a table-driven approach for testing multiple scenarios

3. **Test Environment**:
   - Set up an isolated test environment
   - Use in-memory database for test data

## Mocking Strategy

### Mock Blockchain Client

The tests will use a mock blockchain client that simulates blockchain interactions:

```go
func setupMockBlockchain(t *testing.T) *mocks.BlockchainClient {
    mockClient := new(mocks.BlockchainClient)
    
    // Setup deposit transaction detection
    mockClient.On("GetTransaction", mock.AnythingOfType("string")).
        Return(&blockchain.Transaction{
            ID: "0x1234567890abcdef",
            From: "external-wallet-address",
            To: "gas-bank-address",
            Value: "10.0",
            Asset: "GAS",
            Status: "CONFIRMED",
        }, nil)
    
    // Setup withdrawal functionality
    mockClient.On("CreateTransaction", 
        mock.AnythingOfType("string"), 
        mock.AnythingOfType("string"), 
        mock.AnythingOfType("string"), 
        "GAS").
        Return(&blockchain.TransactionCreation{
            TxID: "0xabcdef1234567890",
            Raw: []byte("raw-transaction-data"),
        }, nil)
    
    // Setup transaction submission
    mockClient.On("SubmitTransaction", mock.AnythingOfType("[]uint8")).
        Return("0xabcdef1234567890", nil)
    
    return mockClient
}
```

### Mock TEE Environment

The tests will use a simulated TEE environment:

```go
func setupMockTEE(t *testing.T) *tee.Manager {
    return tee.NewManager(&config.Config{
        TEE: config.TEEConfig{
            Enabled: false, // Use simulation mode for tests
        },
    })
}
```

## Test Sequence

The tests will be executed in the following sequence:

1. Setup test environment
2. Run deposit flow tests
3. Run withdrawal flow tests
4. Run balance management tests
5. Run fee handling tests
6. Run error handling and recovery tests
7. Clean up test environment

## Implementation Timeline

| Days | Task | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1-2  | Setup | Create mock services and test environment |
| 3-4  | Deposit Tests | Implement deposit flow tests |
| 5-6  | Withdrawal Tests | Implement withdrawal flow tests |
| 7-8  | Balance Tests | Implement balance management tests |
| 9-10 | Fee and Error Tests | Implement fee handling and error recovery tests |

## Dependencies

The implementation depends on the following components:

1. Gas Bank service implementation
2. Mock blockchain client
3. Integration test framework
4. TEE simulation environment

## Success Criteria

The Gas Bank integration tests will be considered complete when:

1. All test cases are implemented and passing
2. Edge cases and error conditions are covered
3. Tests demonstrate correct balance management
4. Tests are included in the CI pipeline
