# Azure TEE Integration Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the Azure Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) integration for the Service Layer.

## Current Status

As documented in COMPONENTS.md and PRODUCTION_READINESS.md, we have made significant progress on the Azure TEE integration:

- ✅ Fixed TokenRequestOptions implementation with correct SDK imports

## Implementation Details

For detailed technical implementation plans, see:

- [TEE Runtime Security Enhancements](TEE_RUNTIME_SECURITY.md) - Technical design for JavaScript runtime security features
- [Memory Limiter Implementation](MEMORY_LIMITER_IMPLEMENTATION.md) - Detailed plan for implementing memory limits
- [Timeout Implementation](TIMEOUT_IMPLEMENTATION.md) - Detailed plan for implementing timeout mechanisms
- [Function Isolation](FUNCTION_ISOLATION.md) - Detailed plan for implementing function isolation
- [TEE Security Testing Specification](TEE_SECURITY_TESTS.md) - Comprehensive test plan for TEE security features

### Function Execution Environment

The function execution environment needs to be enhanced with the following features:

1. **Memory Limits**:
   - Implement configurable memory limits using the JavaScript runtime capabilities
   - Add monitoring for memory usage during execution
   - Implement graceful termination when limits are exceeded
   - See [MEMORY_LIMITER_IMPLEMENTATION.md](MEMORY_LIMITER_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for details

2. **Timeout Implementation**:
   - Add context-based timeout for function execution
   - Ensure resources are properly cleaned up after timeout
   - Add logging for timeout events
   - See [TIMEOUT_IMPLEMENTATION.md](TIMEOUT_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for details

3. **Function Isolation**:
   - Ensure each function execution has its own isolated context
   - Prevent cross-function data access
   - Implement proper cleanup between executions
   - See [FUNCTION_ISOLATION.md](FUNCTION_ISOLATION.md) for details

4. **Runtime Sandboxing**:
   - Restrict access to system resources
   - Limit available JavaScript APIs to a safe subset
   - Add runtime security hooks for monitoring
   - See implementation details in the documents linked above

### Secret Management Integration

1. **Secret Encryption**:
   - Implement envelope encryption for secrets
   - Use TEE capabilities for key protection
   - Add key rotation capabilities

2. **Secret Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control for secrets
   - Add fine-grained permission system
   - Ensure secrets are only accessible within TEE

3. **Secret Usage Auditing**:
   - Add detailed logs for all secret access
   - Implement tamper-proof audit trail
   - Create reporting capabilities for compliance

### TEE Attestation Enhancement

1. **Attestation Cache**:
   - Implement time-based caching for attestation tokens
   - Add invalidation mechanism for policy changes
   - Optimize performance with efficient cache design

2. **Policy Enforcement**:
   - Create attestation policy definition schema
   - Implement policy validation logic
   - Add support for custom policy requirements

## Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Key Deliverables |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | Week 1 | Memory Limits Implementation |
| 2 | Week 1-2 | Timeout Implementation |
| 3 | Week 2-3 | Function Isolation |
| 4 | Week 3-4 | Secret Management, Attestation Enhancements |
| 5 | Week 4-5 | Comprehensive Testing |

## Success Criteria

The TEE integration will be considered complete when:

1. All JavaScript functions execute securely within the TEE
2. Secrets are properly encrypted and only accessible within the TEE
3. Attestation is properly verified and enforced
4. All components have comprehensive test coverage (see [TEE Security Testing Specification](TEE_SECURITY_TESTS.md))
5. Performance meets the required benchmarks
