# GasBank Service Test Fixes

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to fix the GasBank service tests, ensuring they align with the updated service interface requirements and properly implement all required mock interfaces.

## Changes Made

### 1. Blockchain Client Mock Update
The mock blockchain client implementation has been updated to correctly implement the blockchain.Client interface:

- Fixed the `CreateTransaction` method signature to match the expected interface:
  ```go
  func (m *mockBlockchainClient) CreateTransaction(ctx context.Context, params blockchain.TransactionParams) (string, error)
  ```

- Added the following blockchain.Client interface methods that were previously missing:
  - GetBlockCount
  - InvokeFunction
  - SignTransaction
  - SendTransaction
  - GetTransaction
  - GetStorage
  - GetBalance

### 2. GasBank Repository Mock
Ensured that the mockGasBankRepository correctly implements all methods required by the models.GasBankRepository interface:

- Account operations: CreateAccount, GetAccount, GetAccountByUserID, GetAccountByWalletAddress, UpdateAccount, ListAccounts
- Transaction operations: CreateTransaction, GetTransaction, GetTransactionByBlockchainTxID, UpdateTransaction, ListTransactionsByUserID, ListTransactionsByAccountID
- Withdrawal operations: CreateWithdrawalRequest, GetWithdrawalRequest, UpdateWithdrawalRequest, ListWithdrawalRequestsByUserID
- Deposit tracking operations: CreateDepositTracker, GetDepositTrackerByTxID, UpdateDepositTracker, ListUnprocessedDeposits
- Balance operations: UpdateBalance, IncrementDailyWithdrawal, ResetDailyWithdrawal

### 3. Test Cases
Updated test cases to use the correct context parameter and to match the actual service method signatures.

## Remaining Issues
There are still build issues in other parts of the codebase, particularly in:

1. **Price Feed Repository**:
   - Various fields are undefined on the PriceData model
   - Type conversion issue between int and string

2. **TEE Implementation**:
   - Undefined type Enclave
   - Missing Runtime field in AzureConfig
   - Undefined fields in ExecutionResult struct
   - Missing methods and field issues

These issues will need to be addressed separately as they are in different components of the service layer.

## Next Steps
1. Run comprehensive tests on the GasBank service once the other dependency issues are resolved
2. Consider similar interface implementation fixes for other service tests
3. Document any additional interface or API changes that may affect other parts of the system
