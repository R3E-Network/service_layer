# Security Testing Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive security testing plan for the Service Layer project.

## Overview

Security testing is essential to ensure that the Service Layer provides a secure platform for executing user functions, managing secrets, and interacting with the blockchain. This plan covers various aspects of security testing, from unit tests to penetration testing.

## Types of Security Tests

### 1. Unit Security Tests

Unit security tests focus on individual components and their security features:

- **Functions Service**
  - ✅ Memory limit enforcement
  - ✅ Timeout enforcement
  - ✅ Function isolation
  - ✅ Input validation and sanitization
  - ✅ Network access controls

- **Secret Management**
  - ✅ Envelope encryption
  - ✅ Key rotation
  - ✅ User isolation
  - ✅ Access control and authorization
  - ✅ Cryptographic implementation

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - ☐ JWT validation
  - ☐ Role-based access control
  - ☐ API key validation
  - ☐ Rate limiting

### 2. Integration Security Tests

Integration security tests focus on the interactions between components:

- **TEE-Blockchain Integration**
  - ☐ Secure transaction creation
  - ☐ Signing security
  - ☐ State verification

- **Function-Secret Integration**
  - ✅ Secret access from functions
  - ✅ Access control enforcement
  - ✅ Audit logging verification

- **API-Service Integration**
  - ☐ Authentication flows
  - ☐ Input validation across boundaries
  - ☐ Error handling and information disclosure

### 3. System Security Tests

System security tests focus on the security of the entire system:

- **Data Protection**
  - ✅ Data encryption at rest
  - ☐ Data encryption in transit
  - ✅ Secure key management

- **Attack Resistance**
  - ☐ SQL injection protection
  - ☐ Cross-site scripting protection
  - ☐ CSRF protection
  - ☐ Command injection protection

- **API Security**
  - ☐ Rate limiting
  - ☐ Request validation
  - ☐ Response validation

### 4. Penetration Testing

Penetration testing attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the system:

- **TEE Security**
  - ☐ Function isolation bypass attempts
  - ☐ Memory limit bypass attempts
  - ☐ Secret access bypass attempts

- **API Security**
  - ☐ Authentication bypass attempts
  - ☐ Authorization bypass attempts
  - ☐ Input validation bypass attempts

- **Network Security**
  - ☐ Communication interception attempts
  - ☐ Man-in-the-middle attack simulation
  - ☐ Denial of service simulation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Expand Unit Security Tests

**Timeline: Week 1**

1. ✅ Implement input validation and sanitization tests for Functions Service
2. ✅ Implement network access control tests for Functions Service
3. ✅ Implement access control and authorization tests for Secret Management
4. ✅ Implement cryptographic implementation tests for Secret Management
5. Implement JWT validation tests for Authentication
6. Implement role-based access control tests for Authorization

### Phase 2: Implement Integration Security Tests

**Timeline: Week 2**

1. Implement TEE-Blockchain integration security tests
2. ✅ Implement Function-Secret integration security tests
3. Implement API-Service integration security tests

### Phase 3: Implement System Security Tests

**Timeline: Week 3**

1. ✅ Implement data protection tests
2. Implement attack resistance tests
3. Implement API security tests

### Phase 4: Perform Penetration Testing

**Timeline: Week 4**

1. Develop and execute TEE security penetration tests
2. Develop and execute API security penetration tests
3. Develop and execute Network security penetration tests

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Test Structure

Each security test will follow this structure:

1. **Preparation**: Set up the test environment and dependencies
2. **Execution**: Perform the security test
3. **Verification**: Verify that security controls are effective
4. **Cleanup**: Clean up test resources

### Testing Tools

We will use the following tools for security testing:

- **Static Analysis**: `gosec` for Go code analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: `nancy` for dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Fuzzing**: Go's built-in fuzzing framework
- **Penetration Testing**: Custom scripts and tools

### Continuous Integration

Security tests will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that security is continuously verified:

1. Static analysis on every commit
2. Unit security tests on every commit
3. Integration security tests on merge to main branch
4. System security tests on merge to main branch
5. Penetration tests on release candidates

## Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ Create a script to run `gosec` on the codebase
2. ✅ Create a script to scan dependencies with `nancy`
3. Implement remaining security tests with focus on:
   - ✅ Access control for Secret Management
   - ✅ Cryptographic implementation for Secret Management
   - JWT validation for Authentication

## Conclusion

This security testing plan provides a comprehensive approach to ensure the security of the Service Layer. By implementing and continuously running these security tests, we can identify and address security vulnerabilities early in the development process, leading to a more secure product.
