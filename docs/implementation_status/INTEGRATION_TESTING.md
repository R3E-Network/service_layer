# Integration Testing Implementation Status

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation status of integration tests for the Service Layer project. Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly to deliver the expected functionality.

## Current Status

We have implemented several key integration tests:

1. **Authentication Flow Tests** (Complete)
   - User registration, login, and token management
   - JWT validation and refresh
   - Permission checking and authorization

2. **Functions and Secrets Integration** (Complete)
   - Function creation with secret access
   - Secret retrieval during function execution
   - Access control validation

3. **TEE and Blockchain Integration** (Complete)
   - Secure transaction signing in TEE
   - Transaction verification
   - Blockchain interaction verification

4. **Oracle Service Tests** (Complete)
   - Data source integration
   - Data transformation pipeline
   - Blockchain contract updates

5. **Price Feed Service Tests** (Complete)
   - Price data source integration
   - Price aggregation and outlier rejection
   - Blockchain contract price updates
   - Error handling and recovery

## In Progress

The following integration tests are currently in development:

1. **Gas Bank Integration**
   - Deposit flow testing
   - Withdrawal flow testing
   - Balance management validation

## Planned Integration Tests

The following tests still need to be implemented:

1. **Automation Service**
   - Trigger creation and validation
   - Event-based execution
   - Time-based execution
   - Price-based execution

2. **Random Number Generation**
   - TEE-based random number generation
   - Blockchain verification
   - Distribution and bias testing

## Implementation Plan

| Week | Focus | Tests |
|------|-------|-------|
| Current | Gas Bank | Deposit flow, withdrawal flow, balance management |
| +1 Week | Automation | Trigger creation, event/time/price-based execution |
| +2 Week | Random Number | TEE generation, blockchain verification, distribution tests |

## Test Environment Setup

Our integration test environment includes:

1. Docker-based test environment with all services
2. Neo N3 private test network
3. Mock external data sources
4. TEE simulation environment

## Next Steps

1. Implement Gas Bank integration tests
2. Set up CI pipeline for automated testing
3. Implement Automation Service integration tests
4. Create comprehensive test reporting

## Dependencies

- Core services must be implemented and unit tested
- Mock services must be available for external dependencies
- Test environment must be properly configured

## Success Criteria

Integration tests will be considered complete when:

1. All planned tests are implemented
2. All tests pass consistently
3. Test coverage meets or exceeds 80% for integration scenarios
4. CI pipeline runs tests automatically on code changes
