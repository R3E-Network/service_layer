# TEE JavaScript Runtime Security Enhancements

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) JavaScript runtime for the Service Layer.

## Overview

The JavaScript runtime environment in the TEE has been enhanced with multiple layers of security to prevent common vulnerabilities and ensure safe execution of user-supplied code. These enhancements address the following security concerns:

1. Function isolation
2. Input/output validation
3. Network access controls
4. Resource limitations
5. Prototype protection
6. Sandbox enforcement

## Implemented Security Measures

### Function Isolation

Each JavaScript function execution occurs in a completely isolated environment:

- Fresh VM instance created for each execution
- Function-specific execution context
- No state persistence between executions
- Complete cleanup of resources after execution

Implementation details are described in the [Function Isolation Implementation](FUNCTION_ISOLATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md) document.

### Input/Output Validation

All inputs and outputs are validated to prevent security issues:

- Function parameters are validated for:
  - Maximum size limits (overall and per-parameter)
  - Suspicious string patterns
  - Excessively large objects/arrays
  - Dangerous prototype modifications

- Function results are similarly validated to ensure they don't contain:
  - Overly large data structures
  - Suspicious patterns
  - References to internal objects

```go
func (r *JSRuntime) validateInputs(value goja.Value) error {
    // Recursive validation of input values
    // Checks for size limits, suspicious patterns, etc.
}

func (r *JSRuntime) validateFunctionParams(params map[string]interface{}) error {
    // Validates overall parameter count and individual parameters
}

func (r *JSRuntime) validateResult(result interface{}) error {
    // Validates function return values
}
```

### Enhanced Network Access Controls

The `fetch` API has been secured with multiple protection layers:

- HTTPS-only connections
- Domain allowlist with fine-grained controls
- Method validation (only allowing safe HTTP methods)
- Header validation (preventing security-sensitive headers for untrusted domains)
- Request/response size limits
- Timeout enforcement
- Rate limiting preparation (infrastructure for more sophisticated rate limiting)
- Suspicious URL pattern detection

```go
func (r *JSRuntime) secureFetch(call goja.FunctionCall) goja.Value {
    // Extensive validation and security checks for network operations
}

func (r *JSRuntime) enforceRateLimit(hostKey string) {
    // Rate limiting for API calls
}
```

### Object Sandbox Enhancement

Additional object sandboxing has been implemented:

- Freezing of all built-in objects to prevent tampering
- Protection against global object access
- Deep object inspection to detect dangerous patterns
- Prevention of access to browser-specific APIs
- Limiting access to native functions

```go
func (r *JSRuntime) setupObjectSandbox() {
    // Creates a secure sandbox by limiting access to unsafe APIs
}
```

### Resource Limitations

Several resource limitations are enforced:

- Memory limits per function execution
- Execution timeouts with proper cleanup
- Maximum object/array sizes
- Request/response size limits for network operations
- Prevention of excessive recursion

### Secure Configuration

The runtime is configured with security in mind:

- Removal of unsafe globals like `eval` and `Function`
- Prevention of timer abuse
- Strict mode enforcement
- Restricted access to sensitive information

## Validation and Testing

The security enhancements have been tested with:

- Penetration testing scenarios
- Input fuzzing
- Boundary testing of limits
- Execution of malicious code samples

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation provides robust security, future enhancements could include:

1. Distributed rate limiting service integration
2. More sophisticated network access controls based on function metadata
3. Enhanced monitoring and alerting for security events
4. Dynamic allowlist management
5. Advanced pattern detection for malicious code

## Conclusion

The enhanced security measures in the TEE JavaScript runtime provide a robust defense against common security vulnerabilities, while still allowing for the execution of user-supplied code in a controlled environment. These measures help ensure that the Service Layer remains secure and reliable for production use.
