# Performance Testing Plan

This document outlines the plan for performance testing of the Service Layer to ensure it meets production readiness requirements.

## Objectives

The objectives of performance testing are to:

1. Verify the system can handle expected load
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Determine system capacity and scaling requirements
4. Establish performance baselines
5. Validate performance-related requirements
6. Measure resource utilization under load

## Performance Metrics

The following key metrics will be tracked during performance testing:

### Response Time
- Average response time
- 90th percentile response time
- 95th percentile response time
- 99th percentile response time

### Throughput
- Requests per second
- Transactions per second

### Resource Utilization
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disk I/O
- Network I/O
- Database connections

### Error Rates
- Percentage of failed requests
- Error types and distribution

## Test Environment

### Hardware Configuration

Testing will be performed in an environment that closely resembles the production environment:

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| CPU | 4 cores per service |
| Memory | 8 GB per service |
| Disk | SSD with 100 GB storage |
| Network | 1 Gbps |

### Software Configuration

| Component | Version/Configuration |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Operating System | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS |
| Database | PostgreSQL 14 |
| Blockchain Node | Neo-Go v0.99.0 |
| TEE Environment | Azure Confidential Computing |

### Monitoring Tools

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- JMeter for load generation
- Custom instrumentation for specific metrics
