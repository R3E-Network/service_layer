# Service Layer Issues and Solutions

## Overview

This document outlines the identified issues in the Service Layer project and the solutions implemented to address them. It serves as a guide for ongoing development and maintenance.

## Identified Issues

### 1. Import Path Conflicts

- **Issue**: The codebase contains references to both `github.com/R3E-Network/service_layer` and `github.com/willtech-services/service_layer`.
- **Solution**: Updated import paths to consistently use `github.com/R3E-Network/service_layer`.

### 2. Module Dependencies

- **Issue**: Missing or incorrect go.mod dependencies.
- **Solution**: Updated go.mod, added the correct version for neo-go, and ran `go mod tidy`.

### 3. Type Duplication

- **Issue**: Duplicate type declarations for `TransactionStatus` and `TransactionType` in both transaction.go and gas_bank.go.
- **Solution**: Renamed types in gas_bank.go to `GasBankTransactionStatus` and `GasBankTransactionType` to avoid conflicts.

### 4. Repository Pattern Issues

- **Issue**: Inconsistent repository interfaces and implementations, missing adapter for the repository package.
- **Solution**: Created a repository package that adapts the database/repositories implementations to handle both sql.DB and sqlx.DB types.

### 5. Neo-Go API Changes

- **Issue**: The neo-go API has changed, causing compatibility issues with our current implementation.
- **Solution**: Updated the go.mod to use a compatible version (v0.99.0) and added a replacement directive.

### 6. Function Field Name Mismatch

- **Issue**: Using `Source` field in JS runtime code while the model uses `SourceCode`.
- **Solution**: Updated the runtime to use the correct field name.

### 7. Type Conversion Issues

- **Issue**: Incorrect type conversions from int to string in various places.
- **Solution**: Replaced string(int) with strconv.Itoa(int) to properly convert integers to strings.

### 8. Duplicate API Response Functions

- **Issue**: Duplicate RespondWithError function in API common package.
- **Solution**: Renamed one to RespondWithErrorMessage to distinguish between different error response patterns.

## Recently Implemented Solutions

### 1. Compatibility Layer for External Dependencies

- **Issue**: External dependencies like Neo-Go SDK have changing APIs between versions.
- **Solution**: Created a compatibility layer in `internal/blockchain/compat/` that provides version-agnostic interfaces to external dependencies.

### 2. Fixed JavaScript Runtime

- **Issue**: The JS runtime in the TEE implementation had several issues with method signatures and unused variables.
- **Solution**: Fixed parameter handling in the ToValue method and removed unused variables.

### 3. Configuration Enhancements

- **Issue**: Missing configuration fields for Neo and Security.
- **Solution**: Added WalletPath to NeoConfig and created a SecurityConfig struct.

### 4. Selective Testing

- **Issue**: Multiple failing tests due to dependency issues.
- **Solution**: Created a selective testing script that runs tests only for components known to be working.

### 5. Documentation Improvements

- **Issue**: Lack of documentation about implementation status and compatibility strategy.
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive documentation explaining component status, compatibility approach, and action items.

### 6. Azure TEE Integration Fix

- **Issue**: TokenRequestOptions was incorrectly imported from azcore instead of azcore/policy.
- **Solution**: Updated the import to use the correct policy.TokenRequestOptions struct and added missing configuration fields.

### 7. Neo-Go Type Conversion Improvements

- **Issue**: Uint256 and Uint160 conversion methods were not robust enough to handle different formats.
- **Solution**: Enhanced the conversion methods to handle hex strings with different formats and lengths.

### 8. JavaScript Runtime Improvements

- **Issue**: The JS runtime had issues with error handling, missing execution context, and no memory limits.
- **Solution**: Added robust error handling, set up execution context for secret access, and implemented memory limits.

### 9. TEE Attestation and Secure Storage

- **Issue**: The Azure TEE implementation lacked proper attestation verification and secure storage mechanisms.
- **Solution**: Implemented attestation token verification, JWT validation, and SGX-specific encryption for secrets.

### 10. JWT Validation Tests

- **Issue**: Missing comprehensive tests for JWT validation and authentication across services.
- **Solution**: Implemented detailed JWT validation test suite covering token structure, signature verification, claims validation, expiration handling, and attack prevention. Also added integration tests for authentication across different services.

### 11. API Documentation

- **Issue**: Lack of comprehensive API documentation for client developers.
- **Solution**: Created detailed OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all core services including Authentication, Functions, and Secrets. Implemented a combined API specification and developed a documentation guide for developers.

### 12. Performance Testing Infrastructure

- **Issue**: Missing performance testing framework to validate production readiness.
- **Solution**: Developed a comprehensive performance testing plan, implemented performance testing framework for function execution, and created automated test execution and reporting scripts.

### 13. Error Handling Framework

- **Issue**: Inconsistent error handling and reporting across different services.
- **Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive error handling strategy with structured error types, consistent error codes, proper error propagation, and correlation through request IDs.

### 14. TEE-Blockchain Integration

- **Issue**: Lack of integration tests between TEE execution environment and blockchain operations.
- **Solution**: Implemented integration tests for TEE-Blockchain interaction, covering successful operations, error handling, event subscriptions, and resource limits.

### 15. Monitoring Infrastructure

- **Issue**: Missing monitoring and health check capabilities for production deployment.
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive Prometheus metrics collection, health check endpoints, and monitoring documentation to ensure production-level observability.

### 16. DevOps Integration

- **Issue**: Lack of deployment infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- **Solution**: Implemented Docker and Kubernetes configurations, GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, and environment-specific configurations for development, staging, and production deployments.

## Ongoing Issues

The following issues still require attention:

1. **TEE Azure Implementation Integration**:
   - Complete integration with hardware TEE in production environments

2. **Blockchain Client**:
   - Add integration with block event subscriptions

3. **JS Runtime**:
   - Options variable declared but not used
   - Issues with ToValue returning value vs error handling

## Recommendations

1. Create comprehensive test suites for all components
2. Establish a clear separation between core models and service-specific models
3. Implement a comprehensive error handling strategy across the system
4. Develop a phased approach to fix remaining issues, focusing on one component at a time

## Next Steps

1. Implement block event subscription in the blockchain client
2. Fix the remaining JS runtime issues
3. Create comprehensive integration tests for all services
4. Improve error handling across the system
5. Complete API documentation with Swagger
6. Set up monitoring with Prometheus
