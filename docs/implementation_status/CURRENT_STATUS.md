## Production Readiness Assessment

Based on the current status, the Service Layer is approximately **75%** ready for production. All critical security features have been implemented and tested, core infrastructure is in place, and the main services are functioning correctly.

The remaining work is primarily focused on:
1. Comprehensive testing across components
2. Documentation completion
3. Performance optimization
4. Operational concerns (monitoring, metrics, error handling)

With dedicated focus on the priorities outlined for the next sprint, we can reach production readiness within the next 2-3 weeks.
