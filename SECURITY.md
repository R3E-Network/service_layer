4. **API Key Rotation**: Automatic API key rotation
5. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Detailed logs of security-relevant actions
6. **Input Validation**: Thorough validation of all inputs
7. **Memory Safety**: Protection against buffer overflows and memory leaks
8. **Security Headers**: Implementation of recommended security headers
9. **Dependency Management**: Regular scanning and updating of dependencies
10. **Secure Development Lifecycle**: Security is integrated into our development process

For more details on our security features, please see our [Security Documentation](docs/security/README.md).

## Security Development Lifecycle

Our development process follows these security principles:

1. **Design Phase**: Threat modeling and security requirements
2. **Implementation Phase**: Secure coding practices and tooling
3. **Testing Phase**: Security testing and vulnerability scanning
4. **Release Phase**: Security review and sign-off
5. **Maintenance Phase**: Monitoring and incident response
