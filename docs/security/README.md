# Security Features

This directory contains documentation for the security features implemented in the Service Layer.

## Implemented Security Features

### [Rate Limiting](./RATE_LIMITING.md)
Protects the API from abuse and ensures fair usage with a dynamic token bucket algorithm that applies different limits based on client identity (IP address, API key, or user ID).

**Key Features:**
- Different limits for authenticated vs. unauthenticated users
- Smooth rate limiting with burst capacity
- Rate limit headers for client feedback
- Monitoring and metrics collection

### [API Key Rotation](./API_KEY_ROTATION.md)
Reduces the risk of unauthorized access by automatically rotating API keys after a certain period or when security events occur.

**Key Features:**
- Scheduled automatic rotation
- User notifications before rotation
- Grace period for smooth transition
- Emergency revocation capabilities

### [Audit Logging](./AUDIT_LOGGING.md)
Provides a tamper-evident record of all security-relevant actions within the system for detection, forensic analysis, and compliance.

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive event logging
- Structured, searchable log format
- Multiple storage locations
- Integrity protection
- Compliance with regulatory requirements

## Security Architecture

The Service Layer implements a defense-in-depth strategy with multiple layers of security:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - OAuth2/OIDC integration
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Fine-grained permissions

2. **Data Protection**
   - Envelope encryption for secrets
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Key rotation mechanisms
   - Secure key management

3. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
   - Request validation middleware
   - Parameterized queries
   - Output encoding
   - Content Security Policy

4. **JavaScript Execution Security**
   - Memory limits
   - Execution timeouts
   - Sandbox isolation
   - Network access controls

5. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Secure configuration management
   - Network security controls
   - Container security
   - Regular security scanning

6. **Monitoring and Incident Response**
   - Real-time security monitoring
   - Anomaly detection
   - Alerting mechanisms
   - Incident response procedures

## Security Compliance

The Service Layer is designed to comply with:

- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR
- HIPAA (when handling health-related data)
- PCI-DSS (when processing payment information)

## Security Testing

Security testing includes:

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular penetration testing
- Threat modeling

## Future Security Enhancements

Planned security improvements include:

1. **Advanced Threat Detection**
   - Machine learning-based anomaly detection
   - User behavior analytics
   - Advanced pattern recognition

2. **Enhanced Secrets Management**
   - Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
   - Automatic secret rotation
   - Secret access auditing

3. **Zero Trust Architecture**
   - Identity-aware proxies
   - Just-in-time access
   - Continuous verification
