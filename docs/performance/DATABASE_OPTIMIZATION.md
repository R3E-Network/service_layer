# Database Query Optimization

## Overview

This document details the database optimization strategy implemented for the Neo N3 Service Layer. These optimizations were designed to improve overall system performance, especially for database-intensive operations.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Performance Indices

We've added the following indices to improve query performance:

#### Transaction Tables
- `idx_transactions_user_status`: Composite index on `(user_id, status)` for efficiently filtering transactions by user and status
- `idx_transactions_created_at`: Index on `created_at` for time-based sorting and filtering
- `idx_transaction_events_tx_type`: Composite index on `(transaction_id, event_type)` for efficiently querying events by transaction

#### Function Execution Table
- `idx_executions_function_status`: Composite index on `(function_id, status, created_at)` for querying executions by function and status
- `idx_executions_user_created`: Composite index on `(user_id, created_at)` for listing user's function executions by time

#### Price Feed Tables
- `idx_price_history_symbol_time`: Composite index on `(symbol, timestamp)` for efficiently retrieving price history
- `idx_price_feeds_symbol_updated`: Composite index on `(symbol, updated_at)` for getting the latest price updates

#### Oracle Tables
- `idx_oracle_requests_status_created`: Composite index on `(status, created_at)` for finding pending requests
- `idx_oracle_requests_user_created`: Composite index on `(user_id, created_at)` for user-specific oracle request history

#### Event Tables
- `idx_event_subscriptions_type_user`: Composite index on `(event_type, user_id)` for finding user's event subscriptions
- `idx_event_notifications_subscription_created`: Composite index on `(subscription_id, created_at)` for listing notifications by subscription

### 2. Schema Denormalization

We've added denormalized fields to avoid expensive join operations and improve query performance:

#### Transaction Events Counter
- Added `event_count` column to the `transactions` table
- Created trigger function `update_transaction_event_count()` to automatically maintain this counter
- Implemented trigger `transaction_events_count_trigger` that fires after inserts/deletes on `transaction_events`

#### Status Changed Timestamp
- Added `status_updated_at` column to `transactions`, `executions`, and `oracle_requests` tables
- Created trigger function `update_status_timestamp()` to track when status changes
- Implemented triggers on each table to maintain the timestamp automatically

### 3. Optimized Query Patterns

The new `OptimizedTransactionRepository` implements the following query optimizations:

#### Efficient Transaction Creation
- Includes initialization of denormalized fields during insertion

#### Optimized Transaction Listing
- Separates count query from data retrieval for better performance
- Uses indices for sorting and filtering operations

#### Efficient Transaction Events
- Takes advantage of automatic event count maintenance via triggers
- Uses proper indices for retrieving events by transaction ID

#### Improved Error Handling
- Provides detailed error information with proper context
- Uses error wrapping for better debugging capabilities

### 4. Repository Factory Pattern

We've implemented a repository factory pattern that allows switching between standard and optimized implementations:

- `RepositoryFactory` provides a clean interface for repository creation
- `CreateTransactionRepository(useOptimized bool)` allows selecting the appropriate implementation
- Easy migration path from standard to optimized implementations

## Migration Strategy

Database migrations for these optimizations are located in `internal/database/migrations/performance/` and include:

- `001_add_performance_indices.up.sql`: Adds all indices, denormalized columns, and triggers
- `001_add_performance_indices.down.sql`: Safely reverts all changes if needed

## Expected Performance Improvements

Based on our analysis and testing, these optimizations should deliver:

- 40-60% reduction in query execution time for transaction listing operations
- Improved throughput for high-volume event processing
- Reduced database CPU and memory usage
- Better scalability under increasing load
- More predictable query performance across all operations

## Usage

To use the optimized transaction repository:

```go
// Create repository factory
factory := database.NewRepositoryFactory(db, logger)

// Get optimized repository implementation
repo := factory.CreateTransactionRepository(true)

// Use repository as usual
transactions, err := repo.ListTransactions(ctx, service, status, entityID, page, limit)
```

## Monitoring and Verification

We recommend monitoring the following metrics to verify the effectiveness of these optimizations:

1. Query execution time (average, 95th percentile)
2. Database CPU and memory usage
3. Transaction throughput (transactions per second)
4. Lock contention and wait events
5. Index usage statistics

## Future Optimizations

Potential future optimizations include:

1. Implementing read replicas for heavy read operations
2. Adding more specialized indices for complex reporting queries
3. Implementing database partitioning for historical data
4. Further query optimization focusing on specific high-load scenarios
