# Component Integration Tests Plan

This document outlines the integration tests needed to verify proper interaction between different components of the Service Layer.

## Integration Test Requirements

Integration tests should verify that components interact correctly with each other in various scenarios. These tests should cover:

1. Data flow between components
2. Error handling and propagation
3. Transaction consistency
4. Security boundary enforcement
5. Performance under realistic workloads

## Implementation Strategy

The integration tests should be implemented with the following considerations:

1. **Test Environment**:
   - Create a shared test environment with mock dependencies
   - Use in-memory databases where possible
   - Mock external blockchain and API interactions

2. **Test Structure**:
   - Organize tests by component interaction
   - Create shared setup methods for common scenarios
   - Use dependency injection for flexibility

3. **Validation Approach**:
   - Verify data consistency across components
   - Check for proper error propagation
   - Validate security boundaries are maintained
   - Ensure proper cleanup of resources

4. **Implementation Phases**:
   - Phase 1: Authentication ↔ Service Components
   - Phase 2: Functions ↔ Blockchain and Functions ↔ Secret Management
   - Phase 3: TEE ↔ Secret Management
   - Phase 4: Remaining component interactions

## Expected Deliverables

1. Integration test suite for each component interaction
2. Documentation of test results
3. Performance metrics from integration scenarios
4. Recommendations for component interface improvements

## Dependencies

- Mocking framework for external dependencies
- Test database setup and teardown utilities
- Blockchain test node configuration
- TEE emulation for testing

## Next Steps

1. Implement Authentication integration tests
2. Create mock implementations for key dependencies
3. Develop shared test utilities for common operations
4. Implement core service component integration tests
