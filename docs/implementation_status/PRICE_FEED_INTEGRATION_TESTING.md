# Price Feed Integration Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing integration tests for the Price Feed service. Price Feed is a critical service that fetches price data from external sources, validates it, and publishes it to the blockchain. The integration tests will verify that all components of the Price Feed service work together correctly.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify price data fetching from multiple sources
2. Validate price aggregation and deviation handling
3. Ensure correct on-chain price update
4. Verify proper error handling for source failures
5. Test update frequency and scheduling

## Test Components

The Price Feed service integration tests will include the following components:

1. **Price Feed Service** - The main service under test
2. **Mock Price Data Sources** - Simulated external price APIs
3. **Blockchain Client** - For verifying on-chain updates
4. **TEE Environment** - For secure price data processing
5. **Database** - For storing price feed configurations and history

## Test Cases

### 1. Price Source Integration

**Description**: Test the ability to fetch price data from configured external sources.

**Test Steps**:

1. Configure multiple mock price sources
2. Fetch price data from each source
3. Verify data format and structure
4. Test error handling for unavailable sources
5. Test timeout handling for slow responses

**Success Criteria**:

- Price data is correctly fetched from all available sources
- Proper error handling for failed source requests
- Correct timeout handling for slow responses

### 2. Price Aggregation

**Description**: Test the aggregation of price data from multiple sources.

**Test Steps**:

1. Configure multiple price sources with varied prices
2. Trigger price aggregation
3. Verify median price calculation
4. Test deviation threshold handling
5. Verify outlier rejection

**Success Criteria**:

- Correct median price calculation
- Proper handling of sources exceeding deviation threshold
- Successful identification and rejection of outliers

### 3. Blockchain Price Updates

**Description**: Test the on-chain price update mechanism.

**Test Steps**:

1. Configure a price feed with mock sources
2. Trigger a complete update cycle
3. Verify contract function calls
4. Test transaction monitoring
5. Verify on-chain price matches aggregated value

**Success Criteria**:

- Price update transaction is correctly submitted
- Transaction is monitored until confirmation
- On-chain price matches the aggregated value

### 4. Update Frequency and Scheduling

**Description**: Test the price update scheduling mechanism.

**Test Steps**:

1. Configure price feeds with different update frequencies
2. Start the scheduling service
3. Verify updates occur at expected intervals
4. Test pausing and resuming updates
5. Verify handling of slow updates

**Success Criteria**:

- Updates occur at the configured frequency
- Pausing and resuming updates works correctly
- Overlapping update cycles are correctly handled

### 5. Error Recovery

**Description**: Test the system's ability to recover from errors.

**Test Steps**:

1. Simulate temporary source failures
2. Verify retry mechanism
3. Test blockchain transaction failures
4. Verify alerting for persistent failures
5. Test recovery after source availability is restored

**Success Criteria**:

- System correctly retries failed source requests
- Failed blockchain transactions are retried
- Alerts are generated for persistent failures
- Normal operation resumes after issues are resolved

## Implementation Approach

The Price Feed integration tests will be implemented using the following approach:

1. **Mock Services**: 
   - Create mock price data sources that return configurable data
   - Implement a mock blockchain client for transaction verification

2. **Test Framework**:
   - Extend the existing integration test framework
   - Use a table-driven approach for multiple test cases

3. **Test Environment**:
   - Set up an isolated test environment with controlled conditions
   - Configure the system with known test parameters

## Mocking Strategy

### Mock Price Sources

The tests will use HTTP servers that respond with configurable price data:

```go
func createMockPriceSource(t *testing.T, prices map[string]float64, shouldFail bool, delayMs int) *httptest.Server {
    return httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        if shouldFail {
            w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
            return
        }
        
        if delayMs > 0 {
            time.Sleep(time.Duration(delayMs) * time.Millisecond)
        }
        
        w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
        json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]interface{}{
            "prices": prices,
            "timestamp": time.Now().Unix(),
        })
    }))
}
```

### Mock Blockchain Client

The tests will use a mock blockchain client that records contract calls:

```go
func setupMockBlockchain(t *testing.T) *mocks.BlockchainClient {
    mockClient := new(mocks.BlockchainClient)
    
    mockClient.On("InvokeContractFunction", 
        mock.Anything, 
        "updatePrice", 
        mock.Anything).
        Return(&blockchain.InvokeResult{
            Success: true,
            TransactionID: "0xabcdef1234567890",
        }, nil)
    
    return mockClient
}
```

## Test Sequence

The tests will be executed in the following sequence:

1. Setup test environment
2. Configure price feed service
3. Run individual test cases
4. Verify expected outcomes
5. Clean up test environment

## Implementation Timeline

| Days | Task | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1-2  | Mock Services | Implement mock price sources and blockchain client |
| 3-4  | Basic Tests | Implement source integration and aggregation tests |
| 5-6  | Blockchain Tests | Implement on-chain update tests |
| 7-8  | Scheduling Tests | Implement update frequency tests |
| 9-10 | Error Recovery Tests | Implement error recovery tests |

## Dependencies

The implementation depends on the following components:

1. Existing integration test framework
2. Mock blockchain client
3. Price Feed service implementation

## Success Criteria

The Price Feed integration tests will be considered complete when:

1. All test cases are implemented and passing
2. Edge cases and error conditions are covered
3. Tests are included in the CI pipeline
4. Documentation is updated with test results
