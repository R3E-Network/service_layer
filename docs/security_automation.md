# Security Testing Automation

## Overview

This document outlines the automated security scanning process implemented for the Neo N3 Service Layer. Security automation is a critical part of our development process, enabling us to continuously monitor and improve the security posture of our codebase. By integrating these security checks into our CI/CD pipeline, we can identify and address security issues early in the development lifecycle.

## Automated Security Checks

The following automated security checks are integrated into our development workflow:

### 1. Go Code Security Scanning (Gosec)

Gosec is a static analysis tool that scans Go code for security issues. It identifies common security problems such as SQL injection, hardcoded credentials, and insecure file operations.

#### Implementation

The Gosec scanning is implemented in our CI/CD pipeline and can be manually executed using the following script:

```bash
./scripts/security/gosec_scan.sh
```

#### Key Features

- Detects over 20 different types of security issues in Go code
- Generates reports in multiple formats (JSON, HTML, JUnit XML)
- Configurable severity levels
- Integration with our CI/CD system

### 2. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

We use multiple tools to scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities. This helps us identify and mitigate risks from third-party packages.

#### Implementation

The dependency vulnerability scanning is implemented in our CI/CD pipeline and can be manually executed using the following script:

```bash
./scripts/security/vulnerability_scan.sh
```

This script uses three complementary tools to provide comprehensive coverage:

1. **govulncheck**: Checks Go packages and modules against the Go vulnerability database
2. **nancy**: Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities using the Sonatype OSS Index
3. **OSV Scanner**: Uses the Open Source Vulnerability database to identify issues across many ecosystems

#### Key Features

- Comprehensive scanning of all direct and transitive dependencies
- Severity classification of vulnerabilities (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- HTML reports with detailed vulnerability information
- Links to vulnerability details and remediation guidance
- Integration with our CI/CD system

#### Sample Report Output

The vulnerability scanning generates a comprehensive HTML report that includes:

- Executive summary of findings
- Total vulnerability counts by severity level
- Detailed information about each vulnerability
- Affected package information
- Remediation recommendations

### 3. Secret and Credential Detection

We scan our codebase for accidentally committed secrets, credentials, and API keys using multiple tools.

#### Implementation

The secret detection is implemented in our CI/CD pipeline and can be manually executed using the following script:

```bash
./scripts/security/secret_scan.sh
```

#### Key Features

- Detects various types of secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Regular expression patterns for common secret formats
- Pre-commit hook integration to prevent secret commits
- Integration with our CI/CD system

### 4. API Security Scanning (OWASP ZAP)

We use OWASP ZAP to perform automated security testing of our API endpoints, identifying common web vulnerabilities such as XSS, CSRF, and injection attacks.

#### Implementation

The API security scanning is implemented in our CI/CD pipeline and can be manually executed using the following script:

```bash
./scripts/security/api_scan.sh
```

#### Key Features

- Passive and active scanning modes
- Comprehensive coverage of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Authentication support for testing protected endpoints
- Detailed reporting of identified issues

## CI/CD Integration

All security automation tools are integrated into our CI/CD pipeline to ensure security checks are performed on every code change.

### GitHub Actions Implementation

```yaml
name: Security Checks

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  gosec:
    name: Gosec Security Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Gosec Security Scanner
        run: ./scripts/security/gosec_scan.sh

  dependency-scan:
    name: Dependency Vulnerability Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Dependency Vulnerability Scanner
        run: ./scripts/security/vulnerability_scan.sh

  secret-scan:
    name: Secret and Credential Detection
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Secret Detection
        run: ./scripts/security/secret_scan.sh

  api-scan:
    name: API Security Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up environment
        run: docker-compose up -d
      - name: Run API Security Scan
        run: ./scripts/security/api_scan.sh
      - name: Tear down environment
        run: docker-compose down
```

## Reporting and Notification

The security automation tools generate reports that are:

1. Stored as artifacts in the CI/CD system
2. Summarized in the CI/CD job output
3. Sent to the security team for review via email/Slack notification
4. Tracked in our issue management system

## Response Process

When security issues are identified by the automated tools, the following process is followed:

1. **Triage**: Evaluate the severity and impact of the identified issue
2. **Prioritization**: Assign priority based on severity and exploit potential
3. **Remediation**: Address the issue with an appropriate fix
4. **Verification**: Confirm the fix resolves the issue
5. **Documentation**: Document the issue and its resolution

## Maintenance and Updates

To ensure our security automation remains effective:

1. Security scanning tools are updated monthly
2. Scanning configurations are reviewed quarterly
3. New security tools are evaluated and integrated as needed
4. False positives are regularly reviewed and rules adjusted

## Conclusion

Our security automation approach provides continuous security assessment of our codebase, dependencies, and API endpoints. By integrating these checks into our development workflow, we can identify and address security issues early, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities in production.

## Next Steps

1. Enhance security automation with additional tools
2. Improve reporting and visualization of security findings
3. Implement automated remediation suggestions
4. Expand coverage to include container security scanning
